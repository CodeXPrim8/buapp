BISON NOTE – PROJECT OVERVIEW &
DEVELOPER SOURCE OF TRUTH
1. Project Overview
Bison Note is an event-based digital payment and celebration platform designed to solve key
challenges in Nigerian party culture. It restores the joy of spraying while eliminating cash handling,
fraud, and legal risk. All value transfer occurs digitally, while physical Bison Notes serve strictly as
ceremonial spray tokens with zero monetary value.
2. Problems Identified
1 Restriction on spraying Naira has reduced the cultural experience of celebrations.
2 Cash handling at events leads to theft, loss, and stress for celebrants.
3 Money vendors exploit guests and celebrants with extreme exchange rates.
4 Digital transfers lack the prestige and visual impact of traditional spraying.
3. Bison Note Solution
Bison Note separates monetary value from ceremonial spraying. Guests transfer value digitally
using BU (Bison Units). Once payment is complete, guests receive physical Bison Notes solely for
spraying. These notes are non-redeemable and carry no financial value, eliminating fraud and
reuse.
4. Platform Roles
1 Guest (Sprayer): Funds BU wallet, sends BU to an event, receives notes, and sprays.
2 Celebrant: Receives BU instantly and withdraws to bank.
3 Vendor (Event Operator): Creates events, confirms payments, issues notes, earns
commissions.
5. Final Confirmed System Flow (Source of Truth)
Bison Note operates on a wallet-first architecture. All users must fund their BU wallets before
participating in events. Events act strictly as routing logic, not wallets.
1 Guest funds BU wallet ( → BU).
2 Vendor creates event and links celebrant wallet.
3 Guest selects event and sends BU.
4 System routes BU directly to celebrant wallet.
5 Vendor receives confirmation and issues physical Bison Notes.
6 Guest sprays ceremonial notes.
6. Security & Anti-Fraud Design
No API exists for redeeming Bison Notes. Physical notes cannot be scanned, exchanged, or
reused. All value is transferred before spraying, making theft and fraud impossible.

9. Legal & Compliance Positioning
Bison Note is not a currency and does not replace the Nigerian Naira. It operates as a digital event
payment and celebration voucher platform, using licensed payment channels in compliance with
Nigerian regulations.
10. Vision
To become the standard digital event payment and celebration platform across Nigeria and Africa,
restoring the joy of spraying while ensuring security, transparency, and innovation
