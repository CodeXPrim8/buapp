# 🔧 Fix Vercel Project Name Error

## ❌ Current Issue
Project name `bu_app` is still showing an error, even though it should be valid.

## ✅ Solution: Use Only Letters

Try these project names (copy-paste exactly):

### Option 1: Simple lowercase (Recommended)
```
buapp
```

### Option 2: With descriptive name
```
bisonnoteapp
```

### Option 3: Short and simple
```
buapp
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Clear the field completely**
   - Select all text in "Project Name" field
   - Delete it completely
   - Type fresh: `buapp` (no spaces, no special characters)

2. **Check for hidden characters**
   - Make sure there are no spaces before or after
   - No special characters (even if they look like letters)
   - Only use lowercase letters: a-z

3. **Try these exact names** (copy-paste):
   ```
   buapp
   ```
   or
   ```
   bisonnote
   ```
   or
   ```
   bisonapp
   ```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **No underscores** - Even though Vercel says they're allowed, sometimes they cause issues
- **No hyphens** - Definitely not allowed
- **No spaces** - Not allowed
- **Only lowercase letters** - Safest option
- **Start with a letter** - Not a digit

## ✅ Recommended Project Name

Use this exact name:
```
buapp
```

This is:
- ✅ Only letters (no special characters)
- ✅ Starts with a letter
- ✅ Short and simple
- ✅ Easy to remember
