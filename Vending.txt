1.in the celebrant page...celebrants should be able to cretae their own event and send invites to guests (now i know it gets complex because it will be real hard for the celebrant to start typing quest unique id one after the other) so for that lets make  user phone numbers to be users unique ID so while users register they must provide phone number. so when the celebrant wants to share he or she invite he or she can see he/her contacts that are registerd in the Bison note app  
2. Now another thing to put in place is linking the celebrants account with the vendor. you know doing the event the vendors role is to create the event and link the celebrants wallet where any BU sent will go straight to the celebrants wallet 
(so the vendors role should be modified to basically sets up a payment gateway with the celebrant event ID {which is the celebrant unique ID} so any BU sent go straight to the celebrants wallet) now what will the vendor see in his or her vending page while setting up the gateway = Sell BU Note then fill  event details then the celebrant unique ID{to link the gateway, so the money sent will go straight to the celebrant} when the form is filled the gate way is created so the vendor can sell phisical BU notes for the guests to spray also the vendor confirms transaction on behave of the celebrant while the BU goest straight to the celebrant wallet)
